# Homework: Context

For this homework, your task is to refactor the `<TOC>` component we
implemented for homework #5. In the current implementation, `<App>`
passes the `breadcrumbs` prop to `<TOC>`, which in turn passes it to
each `<Entry>`. Instead, use context so that breadcrumbs are available
anywhere in the components tree.

# Homework: Events

For this homework, you will implement a `RadioSet` component. The
component should render a `<fieldset>` with radio inputs. It must accept
the following three props:

- The shared `name` attribute for all radio inputs.
- The [set] of `options` to display as radio inputs, where each option
  has a value and a label.
- An `onChange` function that is called with the selected value when the
  user clicks on a radio input.

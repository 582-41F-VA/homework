# Homework: State (cont.)

Your task for this homework is to create a `Password` component that
renders an input of type "password", as well as a button to toggle the
password's visiblity. The following criteria are listed below the input:

- 8 characters minimum
- At least one uppercase character
- At least one digit

These criteria are checked (âœ“) as they are met by users. When the input
first receives focus, it is highlighted in red. Once all criteria are
met, the input turns green, and the component invokes the `onValid`
event handler with the password as its argument.

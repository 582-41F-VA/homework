# Homework: Props

For this homework, you will create two components used for building
forms:

- A `Field` component that renders an `<input>` together with its
  `<label>`. The input name and the label is required whenever the
  component is used. You can also set the input type (defaults to
  "text"), as well as an optional placeholder and default value.

- A `SubmitButton` component that renders a "Submit" `<button>`. It
  should allow customization of its `color` and `background-color`
  properties.
